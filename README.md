A Writing Support System
This repository contains source files for a writing support system, which is based on a mixture of NLP techniques.
The code includes:
1) Training language models with neural networks, and recurrent neural networks
2) Text processing, vocabulary extraction, etc.

The code is mostly written in python, and based on keras package
